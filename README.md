<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nikita Padey</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate software developer from France</h3>

<p>I'm Nikita Padey, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a student Software Developer at LaPlateforme.
With over 1 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.<\p>

<h1>ðŸš€ Expertise <\h1>
  
<p> Passionate about crafting interactive and intuitive user experiences, I specialize in front-end web development, combining modern frameworks with best practice design patterns. With almost 7 years dedicated to honing my skills in front-end technologies, I've led teams, designed system guidelines, and upheld the highest standards in web performance and SEO.

In my professional journey, I've proudly served as a Front-end Technical Lead as well, a role where my technical expertise met the challenges of team management. Beyond crafting top-tier user interfaces, I embraced the responsibilities of leadership, guiding my team with strategic oversight, and ensuring projects were executed efficiently.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I've embraced the role of a "content creator" within the technology sphere. My approach is distinct; I aim to offer a fresh perspective on tech, blending insights with a dash of humor.

Outside of the professional environment, I nurture a unique passion: creating "art" using exclusively CSS. This activity not only sharpens my technical prowess but also allows me to blend programming and creativity in a uniquely captivating way.
